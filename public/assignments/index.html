Assignment 1# Assessing Your Interests# Repository
Finding your interests can sometimes feel like finding stars in the mix of others, as shown in Figure 1; you know that they are out-there but sometimes, they are hard to find when you first start looking. The goal of this assignment is to help you identify where your interests lie in the area of computer science and then to get you started thinking about how you can combine those interests into a senior project proposal that will be exciting and rewarding.

<p>To learn how to set up a Hugo and Netlify to create a website which will play the part of a research notebook.
In this assignment, we will be setting up an online research notebook in which you are to record the progress in your research. For this task, we will use Hugo and Netlify. For many of your assignments, you will use your website to add your progressive thinking, article summaries, a bibliography, implementations and other aspects of your work.</p>

<p>No Repository necessary.</p>
<p>For your senior thesis work, you will have a first and second reader to assist in your work. Although you are invited to select your readers based on their research area(s) and its alignment with your idea area, this may not be the only criteria that you could apply to your voting. You are not necessarily guaranteed to get the readers that you select but your selection will help in the reader assignment decision making process. We will be voting using an online form.</p>
