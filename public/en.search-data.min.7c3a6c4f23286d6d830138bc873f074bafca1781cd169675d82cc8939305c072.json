[{"id":0,"href":"/assignments/","title":"Assignments","section":"Preparation for Research","content":"Descriptions and Objectives of Course Assignments# Note: All the assignments (except for the one concerning voting for readers) are contained in the GitHub repository, Devising-Research.\nAssignment 1# Assessing Your Interests# Repository\nFinding your interests can sometimes feel like finding stars in the mix of others, as shown in Figure 1; you know that they are out-there but sometimes, they are hard to find when you first start looking. The goal of this assignment is to help you identify where your interests lie in the area of computer science and then to get you started thinking about how you can combine those interests into a senior project proposal that will be exciting and rewarding.\nAssignment 2# Topic Exploration For a Senior Thesis Proposal# Repository\nTo learn how to use public online searches to locate and read peer-reviewed articles in the literature to the benefit of a research interest and software tools to help facilitate your research.\nAssignment 3# Using Hugo and Netlify to Design an Online Research Notebook# Repository\nTo learn how to set up a Hugo and Netlify to create a website which will play the part of a research notebook. In this assignment, we will be setting up an online research notebook in which you are to record the progress in your research. For this task, we will use Hugo and Netlify. For many of your assignments, you will use your website to add your progressive thinking, article summaries, a bibliography, implementations and other aspects of your work.\nAssignment 4# Bridging the Gap Between the Known and Unknown# Repository\nTo contemplate the deliverable of your research project by identifying the knowledge gap motivated by relevant literature. This assignment will invite the student to consider the end-product so as to begin to set goals for a senior thesis research project.\nAssignment 5# Repository\nFeasibility: How do-able is my project?# To determine some of the parameters which are necessary to complete a technical project. To explore the available resources at hand (i.e., tools, skills, literature, data, and etc.) which will be applied to the completing of the project. To inquire whether a project can be completed in a given time frame (2-3 months) with the application of the available tools.\nAssignment 6# Prototype: A Foundational Deliverable# Repository\nTo design and implement a prototype tool that can run experiments, collect data, and analyze results. To write clear documentation, which allows others to use the tool, and to demonstrate the implemented prototype.\nAssignment 7# Voting for your First and Second reader# No Repository necessary.\nFor your senior thesis work, you will have a first and second reader to assist in your work. Although you are invited to select your readers based on their research area(s) and its alignment with your idea area, this may not be the only criteria that you could apply to your voting. You are not necessarily guaranteed to get the readers that you select but your selection will help in the reader assignment decision making process. We will be voting using an online form.\nAssignment 8# Experiment: Answering a Research Question using a Prototype# Repository\nTo design and conduct an experiment using developed prototype to collect preliminary data with a goal of answering at least one research question connected to the research project idea.\nAssignment 9# Final Deliverable# Repository\nTo connect the work from the semester to introduce, motivate, and explain a research idea in terms of its scope, feasibility, developed prototype, and preliminary results from run experiments.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/resources/finding-data/","title":"Finding Data","section":"Research Resources","content":"Finding usable data for technical research# Data work is a major part of computer science research.

All percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so presents itself, it is possible for the assigned percentages to change during the academic semester.\nCategory Percentage Assessment metric Class Participation 10% check mark grade Assignments 50% letter grade Final Project 40% letter grade Total 100% Grading Scale# Letter Range Letter Range Letter Range A 96 - 100 A- 90 - 95.9 B+ 87 - 89.9 B 83 - 86.9 B- 80 - 82.9 C+ 77 - 79.9 C 73 - 76.9 C- 70 - 72.9 D+ 67 - 69.9 D 63 - 66.9 F 59.9 and below Definitions of Grading Categories# Class Participation: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required reading assignments, completing in-class exercises, asking constructive questions of the other members of the class, giving presentations, leading a discussion session in class.\nAssignments (in class and laboratory): These assignments invite students to explore the concepts, tools, and techniques associated with the field of the class. Skills which were discuss in class will be important to students for their work on these assignments. Unless specified otherwise, each laboratory assignment will be due at the beginning of the next laboratory session. Some of the assignments in this course will expect students to give both a short presentation and a demonstration of their work and efforts.\nFinal Project: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated project. Completion of the final project will require you to apply all of the work and skills that you have already acquired in the course during the semester to address a research problem. The details for the final project will be given in class.\nAssignment Submissions# Your instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use git to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.\nThe three basic commands for submitting work are the following.\ngit add -A git commit -m \u0026#34;informative message\u0026#34; git pushLate Submissions# All assignments will have a stated due date. The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late.\nAssignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. After that time, the assignment\u0026rsquo;s grade will not be accepted.\nExtensions# Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline. If you are requesting extensions for a lab assignment, then you are to email me with your request and also provide a valid reason for your extension. This request must come before the due date of the lab and not on the due date.\nThe decision to provide you with an extension (or not) will be weighed in light of fairness to your peers who are still able to complete their labs, regardless of their own busy schedules.\nCommunication# Various digital channels will be used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. It is strongly advised for the student to install the Discord app on their computer and smart-phone to be sure to receive all communications from the instructor, as well as, the other members of the class.\nAdditionally, the course website will be used to store the syllabus, course schedule and information about the classDocs/ repository using the GitHub. Your grades will be communicated to you by a Gradebook GitHub repository.\nBring your own computer to class# The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.\nDuring the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following resource.\nSpecial Needs and Disability Services# The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.\nSome of the resources on campus are listed below.\nMaytum Center for Student Success Allegheny College Counseling Center The Winslow Health Center Student Life Honor Code# The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalogue. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:\nI hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.\nIt is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else\u0026rsquo;s work. While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, technical diagrams, proposals, paper reviews, presentations, and other items with their classmates or other individuals, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.\nMore information about the code may be found at the Maytum Center for Student Success\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/resources/reading-literature/","title":"Reading the Literature","section":"Research Resources","content":"Efficient reading for computer science research# Reading papers is how you build context and find gaps.
