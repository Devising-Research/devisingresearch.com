<meta name="description" content="Teaching research to college students# Teaching research is about helping students move from curiosity to evidence. The course works best when students experience discovery early and often.
Create excitement and momentum# Start with a short mystery or puzzle tied to real data. Use a one class micro study so students see a full cycle. Share quick wins: a chart, a prototype, or a surprising result. Spotlight student work in a weekly “show and tell”. Make discovery feel possible# Provide a small dataset that is already clean. Give a starter notebook or code template. Use pair work for the first 2 weeks to reduce risk. Frame research as iterative, not perfect on the first try. Teach research question finding# Have students write 10 questions in 10 minutes. Sort questions into descriptive, comparative, and causal. Use the template: “How does X affect Y under Z?” Ask students to narrow to one measurable outcome. Teach answer chasing# Identify one baseline method and one improvement. Require a small pilot with results in week 3 or 4. Have students track decisions in a research log. Teach “failure analysis”: what did not work and why. Build a research interest and area# Use theme weeks: privacy, AI, health, networks, or HCI. Invite a 10 minute guest talk from a local researcher. Give students a menu of data sources aligned to the theme. Ask for a 2 sentence interest statement every two weeks. Assessment ideas# Evaluate clarity of question and scope, not just results. Grade on iteration: question, pilot, revision, and final. Use a peer review round for research proposals. Class structures that work well# 15 minutes: mini lecture or demo 20 minutes: lab style activity 15 minutes: group check in and planning 10 minutes: share outs or reflections A short activity to open the course# Show a small dataset or system output. Ask students to write 5 questions about it. Vote on the most interesting question. Spend 20 minutes analyzing the data together. End with a reflection: what else would we need to know? ">
