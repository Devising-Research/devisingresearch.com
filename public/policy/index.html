<h3 id="definitions-of-grading-categories">Definitions of Grading Categories<a class="anchor" href="#definitions-of-grading-categories">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Participation</strong>: All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. Your participation will take forms such as answering questions about the required reading assignments, completing in-class exercises, asking constructive questions of the other members of the class, giving presentations, leading a discussion session in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignments (in class and laboratory)</strong>: These assignments invite students to explore the concepts, tools, and techniques associated with the field of the class. Skills which were discuss in class will be important to students for their work on these assignments. Unless specified otherwise, each laboratory assignment will be due at the beginning of the next laboratory session.  Some of the  assignments in this course will expect students to give both a short presentation and a demonstration of their work and efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong>: This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated project. Completion of the final project will require you to apply <strong>all</strong> of the work and skills that you have already acquired in the course during the semester to address a research problem. The details for the final project will be given in class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assignment-submissions">Assignment Submissions<a class="anchor" href="#assignment-submissions">#</a></h3>
<p>Your instructor will be using GitHub Classroom to collect all assignments. It is expected that you are able to effectively use <code>git</code> to submit your work. If you require help, please see your peers, the Technology Leaders, or your instructor.</p>
<p>The three basic commands for submitting work are the following.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add -A
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;informative message&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions<a class="anchor" href="#late-submissions">#</a></h3>
<p>All assignments will have a stated due date. The electronic version of the class assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the lab session on the due date. Submissions after the beginning of class are counted as being late.</p>
<p><strong>Assignments will be accepted for up to one week past the assigned due date with a 15% penalty. After that time, the assignment&rsquo;s grade will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<h3 id="extensions">Extensions<a class="anchor" href="#extensions">#</a></h3>
<p>Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, <strong>no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.</strong> If you are requesting extensions for a lab assignment, then you are to email me with your request and also provide a valid reason for your extension. This request must come before the due date of the lab and <strong>not</strong> on the due date.</p>
<p>The decision to provide you with an extension (or not) will be weighed in light of fairness to your peers who are still able to complete their labs, regardless of their own busy schedules.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication<a class="anchor" href="#communication">#</a></h3>
<p>Various digital channels will be used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. It is strongly advised for the student to install the Discord app on their computer and smart-phone to be sure to receive all communications from the instructor, as well as, the other members of the class.</p>
<p>Additionally, the course website will be used to store the syllabus, course schedule and information about the <code>classDocs/</code> repository using the GitHub.  Your grades will be communicated to you by a Gradebook GitHub repository.</p>
<h3 id="bring-your-own-computer-to-class">Bring your own computer to class<a class="anchor" href="#bring-your-own-computer-to-class">#</a></h3>
<p>The classrooms in the Department of Computer Science no longer provide machines for student use. You are to bring your own wifi-ready device to class to be able to follow along with course material. If the class is meeting online using Zoom, then please be sure that you machine is configured correctly to use these services to connect you to the class. As it is your responsibility to maintain your machine, please perform online research to determine how to configure your machine accordingly, or to install any necessary software to enable online meetings.</p>
<p>During the semester, you will be told which software to install on your machine to be prepared for class. Some of the prominent software that we may be using can be found at the following <a href="https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/">resource</a>.</p>
<h3 id="special-needs-and-disability-services">Special Needs and Disability Services<a class="anchor" href="#special-needs-and-disability-services">#</a></h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities.  Among other things, this legislation requires all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability Services at 332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Some of the resources on campus are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/">Maytum Center for Student Success</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/">Allegheny College Counseling Center</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/">The Winslow Health Center</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code<a class="anchor" href="#honor-code">#</a></h3>
<p>The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Course Catalogue.  The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.  This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the final project).  All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:</p>
<p><em>I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.</em></p>
<p>It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else&rsquo;s work.  While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss their programs, technical diagrams, proposals, paper reviews, presentations, and other items with their classmates or other individuals, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.</p>
<p>More information about the code may be found at the <a href="https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentsuccess/academic-honor-program/">Maytum Center for Student Success</a></p>
