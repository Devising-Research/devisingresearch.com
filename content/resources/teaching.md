## Teaching research to college students

Teaching research is about helping students move from curiosity to evidence. The course works best when students experience discovery early and often.

### Create excitement and momentum

- Start with a short mystery or puzzle tied to real data.
- Use a one class micro study so students see a full cycle.
- Share quick wins: a chart, a prototype, or a surprising result.
- Spotlight student work in a weekly "show and tell".

### Make discovery feel possible

- Provide a small dataset that is already clean.
- Give a starter notebook or code template.
- Use pair work for the first 2 weeks to reduce risk.
- Frame research as iterative, not perfect on the first try.

### Teach research question finding

- Have students write 10 questions in 10 minutes.
- Sort questions into descriptive, comparative, and causal.
- Use the template: "How does X affect Y under Z?"
- Ask students to narrow to one measurable outcome.

### Teach answer chasing

- Identify one baseline method and one improvement.
- Require a small pilot with results in week 3 or 4.
- Have students track decisions in a research log.
- Teach "failure analysis": what did not work and why.

### Build a research interest and area

- Use theme weeks: privacy, AI, health, networks, or HCI.
- Invite a 10 minute guest talk from a local researcher.
- Give students a menu of data sources aligned to the theme.
- Ask for a 2 sentence interest statement every two weeks.

### Assessment ideas

- Evaluate clarity of question and scope, not just results.
- Grade on iteration: question, pilot, revision, and final.
- Use a peer review round for research proposals.

### Class structures that work well

- 15 minutes: mini lecture or demo
- 20 minutes: lab style activity
- 15 minutes: group check in and planning
- 10 minutes: share outs or reflections

## A short activity to open the course

1. Show a small dataset or system output.
2. Ask students to write 5 questions about it.
3. Vote on the most interesting question.
4. Spend 20 minutes analyzing the data together.
5. End with a reflection: what else would we need to know?
