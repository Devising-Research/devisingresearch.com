## A practical workflow for a technical project

This workflow is designed for computer science and data driven projects that run in a semester.

### Phase 1: Define

- Research question and motivation
- Short list of related work
- Feasibility check and scope limits

### Phase 2: Design

- Data plan and access method
- Baseline or comparison approach
- Evaluation metrics and success criteria

### Phase 3: Build and test

- Small prototype or pilot study
- Iterative experiments with clear logs
- Version control for code and data

### Phase 4: Analyze

- Clean the data and track decisions
- Run the analysis more than once
- Validate results with simple checks

### Phase 5: Communicate

- Write a focused abstract first
- Use figures that show comparisons
- Document limitations and next steps

## Reproducibility tips

- Use a README for setup and commands.
- Pin package versions when possible.
- Keep raw data separate from processed data.
- Save experiment settings and parameters.
