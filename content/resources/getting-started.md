## A fast start for technical research

Use this page as a short launch plan when you are new to academic research in computer science.

### Step 1: Pick a narrow area

- Choose a topic area you can explain in one sentence.
- Write 3 to 5 keywords that describe the area.
- Note the systems or artifacts involved: software, hardware, or data.

### Step 2: Turn interest into a question

- Ask a question that can be tested or explored.
- Avoid questions that are too broad or only opinion based.
- Example pattern: "How does X affect Y under Z conditions?"

### Step 3: Set a scope boundary

- Identify the time window for your data.
- Limit the number of datasets or systems.
- Define what you will not do.

### Step 4: Decide on a method

- Will you build a system, analyze data, or run a small study?
- Pick tools you already know or can learn quickly.
- Add a short list of metrics or outcomes.

### Step 5: Check feasibility

- Can you access data and computing resources?
- Can you complete a prototype in 1 to 2 weeks?
- Does the project need ethical review?

### Step 6: Write a one page plan

- Research question
- Why it matters
- Data or system plan
- Deliverables and timeline

## Quick checklist

- I can explain my research question in 20 seconds.
- I can name 3 papers that are closely related.
- I can access the data or systems needed.
- I have a small prototype plan.
- I know what success looks like.
