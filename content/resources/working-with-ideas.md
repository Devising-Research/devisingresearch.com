## Turning ideas into research directions

Ideas are raw material. This page helps you shape them into research directions that are testable and clear.

### Capture

- Keep a simple research log in a notebook or text file.
- Record the date, the idea, and where it came from.
- Add short tags like "security", "data", or "HCI".

### Expand

- Write 3 variants of the idea.
- Change the dataset, the user group, or the system.
- Ask "What would make this measurable?"

### Check novelty

- Search for 3 to 5 recent papers on the same idea.
- Write one sentence about what each paper does.
- Identify gaps or missing evaluations.

### Evaluate feasibility

- Can you build a small experiment fast?
- Is there data you can access quickly?
- Are the tools within your skill range?

### Ask for feedback

- Share a 2 to 3 sentence pitch with a peer.
- Request one criticism and one improvement.
- Revise the idea based on the feedback.
