#### Welcome Statement

Hello! Welcome to research!

Of research, a wise person once wrote that, __one never completes a research project in isolation of others__. This bright quote signifies that finding and correctly harnessing appropriate __resources__ for research is what makes for a successful conclusion. 

On this page, I will be adding links and short discussions for some of the resources that I think might be helpful to you in your adventures in your investigative work in science.
