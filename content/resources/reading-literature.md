## Efficient reading for computer science research

Reading papers is how you build context and find gaps. Use a layered approach that matches your time.

### The 3 pass method

- Pass 1 (5 to 10 minutes): Read the title, abstract, and conclusion.
- Pass 2 (20 to 30 minutes): Scan figures, tables, and methods.
- Pass 3 (deep read): Study the details and take structured notes.

### What to record in your notes

- Problem statement
- Key contributions
- Methods or algorithms used
- Dataset and evaluation metrics
- Limitations or open questions

### Build your citation graph

- Start with 2 to 3 anchor papers.
- Use references to go backward in time.
- Use citation lists to go forward in time.
- Keep a short list of recurring authors and venues.

### Reading strategies

- Group papers by method, not by topic.
- Compare evaluation metrics across papers.
- Ask: "What would I change or test next?"

### Tool suggestions

- A citation manager (Zotero, Mendeley, or BibTeX)
- A notes template you reuse for every paper
- A shared folder for PDFs and datasets
