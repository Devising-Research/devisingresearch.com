## Finding usable data for technical research

Data work is a major part of computer science research. This guide helps you locate and evaluate data quickly.

### Common data sources

- Government and public agencies
- Research group releases and project websites
- Open repositories and data portals
- APIs and platform data exports

### What to check before using a dataset

- License: can you use it for academic work?
- Format: CSV, JSON, SQL dump, or raw text?
- Documentation: is there a data dictionary?
- Coverage: does it match your time range and scope?
- Bias: who created it and what might be missing?

### Practical steps

1. Write 5 keywords about the data you need.
2. Search for "dataset" plus each keyword.
3. Check the data size and file format.
4. Download a sample and inspect 20 rows.
5. Record the source and citation details.

### If the data is not available

- Create a small dataset through scraping, logs, or experiments.
- Use a related dataset and justify the substitution.
- Reframe the question to fit accessible data.

### Data hygiene checklist

- The data is versioned and stored safely.
- You can reproduce how it was collected.
- You have a clear plan for cleaning and filtering.
- You are aware of privacy or ethics constraints.
